This was a project for the course CS 461 in Drexel University, Spring '16. 

Project included creating a database and using it. Written with Java. We choose to made a sample IBDB, where the idea is the same as with IMDB but for the books. So it is basically an online database for books. 

* You can find the source code in java, and
* You can find the queries and feeding SQls in db_related folder.
